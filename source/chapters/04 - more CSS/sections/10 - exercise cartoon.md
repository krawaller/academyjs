Our newfound knowledge leaves us no choice - we absolutely must **add transitions and animations** to our game!

Look your game over, and **any place where you can cram movement, do it**!

~~~

When you're done, **add new files**, **commit**, **push** and do a **PR** as per usual!

~~~

**Challenge**: For extra annoyment points, **read up on `transform`** and do some **`transition` or `transformation`** with that! I have it from good authority that **users LOVE when you use `skew`**! Promise!
