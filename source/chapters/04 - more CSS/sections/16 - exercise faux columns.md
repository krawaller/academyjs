title: Exercise - Faux columns
tagline: The holy grail

We mentioned **columns of equal height** before:

![](resources/images/fauxcols.png)

~~~

More specifically, we mean

* Two columns who **both extend to the bottom of their parent**
* The **longest column desides the height of the parent**

As previously stated, this is **very difficult with regular CSS**.

~~~

But, **rather easy with Flexbox**, which is what I used to create the screenshot!

And now, of course it is your turn to **recreate the screenshot using HTML and CSS**!

~~~

Some pointers;

* I got the **text** from [http://baconipsum.com/](http://baconipsum.com/)
* The **structure** should just be a div with two divs inside
* You will **need to play with `flex` on the children**
* Experiment yourself first, but if you get stuck then **go googling**!

**Challenge**: If you're really serious about your webdev chops, find a way to **steal my exact colours**!
