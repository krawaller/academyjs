title: Introducing JavaScript
tagline: better the devil you know

So, **JavaScript**! It is:

* Functional
* Object Oriented
* Dynamically typed
* Loosely typed
* Syntactically C-like

What?
~~~

**Functional**, meaning that it **emphasizes the application of functions**

This in contrast to imperative programming, which **emphasizes changes in state**.

~~~

**Object Oriented**, meaning that it **uses objects** (data structures consisting of data and behavior) and that **most things are objects**.

~~~

**Dynamically typed**, meaning that it **performs the majority of its type checking at run-time** as opposed to at compile-time

~~~

**Loosely typed**, meaning that **any value can be stored in any variable or bound to any parameter**, and JavaScript will do any necessary conversions.

~~~

**Syntactically C-like**, for instance it has..

* `{...}` for blocks
* `;` as a statement separator
* `=` for assignment
* `/* ... */` and `//` for comments
