This is a small **intermission exercise** to do some **practicing on CSS selectors**. You'll need...

* a **reference** at the ready - MDN works fine
* **an opponent or two**. Literaly - you must be 2 or 3 people.

Go to [http://blog.krawaller.se/cssbattle/](http://blog.krawaller.se/cssbattle/), and you're met with this simple form:

~~~

Enter the **same room as your opponent(s)**, but using **different names**. You will then all end up in the same **battle arena**:

Each of you can **set your selector**, and **everyone sees everyone's results**.

There are **no hardcoded rules**, but we suggest you **take turn to make a selection**, and then the other(s) should **make the same selection** as fast as possible.
