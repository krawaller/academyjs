Let's look at the first part of CSS - **selectors**!

Just like CSS splits into selectors and style rules, so does **selectors split into descriptions and combinators**.

These are again two completely different things, so we can even make the case that **CSS consists of 3 different languages**!

We touched on CSS' bad rep for not being very good at doing layout.

CSS selectors, however, are **very good at what they do**, namely select a subset of elements from a document.

~~~

In fact, CSS selectors are so efficient that **JavaScript stole them**, because they got the job done better than the programmatic interface that existed before!

Many **modern JS frameworks also use CSS selectors**, so all in all there are **many good reasons to learn them well**.

So let's go do that!
