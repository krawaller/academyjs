title: Exercise - Ninjaness
tagline: are you a ninja or a hyakushō?
---

For each part of the holy trinity, and for your interest in the web platform, **rate yourself** on a scale of 1-10 where **1 is hyakushō** and **10 is ninja**!

(I promise to try to not let the answer to question 4 affect me)

Throughout the week we'll be **using Github for exercise submissions**. This "exercise" serves as an excuse to try that process out.

~~~

To submit;

* jot down your answers in a simple **text file**
* **fork the repo** at [github.com/krawaller/academysubs](https://github.com/krawaller/academysubs)
* **download the repo** to your computer
* make sure you are working in the **`gh-pages` branch**
* create a folder named after your github user in `submissions/ninjaness`.
* **add the text file** with your answers to that folder 
* **commit** the changes
* **push** to your fork
* now **make a pull request**!
