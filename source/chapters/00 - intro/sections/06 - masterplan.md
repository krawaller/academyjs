Here follows some points on what is to follow!

~~~

* The gist: during this week I will teach you the **basics of web development**.
* Exactly **what that entails is not set in stone** - I have the basics prepared, and then there are many roads to take, especially around the JavaScript parts. 
* We will **make those decisions together** as the course progresses.

~~~

* The web course will be **centered around these slides**.
* They are **available online** at [http://blog.krawaller.se/academyjs/slides](http://blog.krawaller.se/academyjs/slides).
* I will **regularly update** them during the week.

~~~

* The **focus will be on concepts and the big picture**, not the nitty gritties.
* We will strive to adhere to **accelerated learning's focus on exercises**, but
* conveying the big picture does **require some dogfooding of theory**.

~~~

* It is **forbidden to keep a question to yourself**. Ask away! Because,
* **there are no stupid questions**. <span style='text-decoration: line-through;'>Only stupid people.</span>
