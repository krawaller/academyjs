On this journey, our primary tool is **a browser**. I primarily use Chrome, but any modern browser will do.

This is not just for consuming web content - the **developer tools** inside the browser is an integral part of our setup. Consider it part of our IDE without the I!

~~~

We also need an **editor**. As HTML, CSS and JavaScript isn't (necessarily) compiled, any text editor can be used, but preferrably one with good web tooling. You have two good choices:

* **Upgrade IntelliJ** (the Community edition does not support JS)
* Install the **free trial for Webstorm** which is very similar

~~~

Finally you need a **good resources** for looking up specifics. I recommend Mozilla Developer Network, or **MDN** for short.

Whichever resource you use, it is important to **have somewhere within reach to go for details**. 

Therefore, choose a resource and **invest time in getting to know it** and know it well, so that future lookups go quick.
