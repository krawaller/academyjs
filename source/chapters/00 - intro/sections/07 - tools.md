On this journey, our primary tool is **a browser**. I primarily use Chrome, but any modern browser will do.

This is not just for consuming web content - the **developer tools** inside the browser is an integral part of our setup. Consider it part of our IDE without the I!

~~~

Another very useful function in the browser is to be able to **view source**. All web apps transmit their entire source code to the browser, so snoop away!

We also need an **editor**. As HTML, CSS and JavaScript isn't (necessarily) compiled, any text editor can be used, but preferrably one with **good web tooling**. You have two good choices:

* **Upgrade IntelliJ** (Community edition doesn't support JS)
* Install the **free trial for Webstorm** which is very similar

~~~

There is an **ongoing religious war** between whether **IDE:s or editors** are the optimum. You don't have to take sides, but it is good to understand the problem to be able to form an opinion.

~~~

We'll likely also **play around with NodeJS**, I haven't quite decided yet.

It is a useful tool anyhow, so if you're curious go ahead and install it!

~~~

Finally you need a **good resources** for looking up specifics. I recommend Mozilla Developer Network, or **MDN** for short.

Find it at [https://developer.mozilla.org/](https://developer.mozilla.org/).

I do **NOT recomment W3Schools**, who will be at the top of every googling. They are good at SEO, not explanations and documentations.

I suggest either

* **blocking them from google results**, or 
* **prefixing your queries with MDN**

~~~

Whichever resource you use, it is important to **have somewhere within reach to go for details**. 

Therefore, choose a resource and **invest time in getting to know it** and know it well, so that future lookups go quick.
