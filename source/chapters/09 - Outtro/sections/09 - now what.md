Again: I've given you the grammar, now **learn the vocabulary**! No shortcuts; you must earn your chops by **coding**.

**Translate Java exercises to Java and the other way around**. This is an **excellent** way to gain perspective.

If you really want to **devote time to learn JS**, go through the free online book **[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)**.

~~~

Finally - **don't be a stranger**! I'd love to know how you're doing, so don't hesitate to **reach out down the road**!

~~~

Peace out! :)
