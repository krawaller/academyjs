There are a number of things about JavaScript programming that we **haven't covered yet** and that you need to know about.

~~~

I'll demo them now, but also wanted to **mention them here in the slides** so you can remember later to check them out.

~~~

First out - the **`this` and `arguments` pseudoarguments** to function calls. They're not really needed, but at the very least you **need to recognize them**.

~~~

Next - **closures and scope**. This is a weird one which will bend your minds for time to come. :)

~~~

Finally - **JavaScript inheritance**. It is a strange subject, made stranger still by the incursion of **functional programming**!
