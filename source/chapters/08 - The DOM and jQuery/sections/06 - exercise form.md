Let's **get you acquainted with the DOM, events and form elements** by - you guessed it - **building a form**!

~~~

Here's your task in detail:

* Make an **html document** containing a **simple form**
* The form should include a submission button
* Add an **event handler to run upon submission**
* In that handler, **collect all the user input and log it to the console**!

~~~

A good start is likely to **spend some time on the MDN form pages** that we linked before, or some other good resource, to **get familiar with form elements and event handling**.

~~~

You don't have to submit your solution, so when your done, just **give a yell**!
