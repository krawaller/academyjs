Armed with a basic understanding of jQuery, we're now going to **get started on their bootcamp**!

It is an **interactive tutorial** somewhat reminiscent of the games we've been playing with for other techniques.

Go to [http://try.jquery.com](http://try.jquery.com) and you'll see this:

Working through the screenshot top to bottom, a challenge consists of:

* an **instruction up top** telling you what to do
* **rendered HTML code** with currently selected elements highlighted
* the **HTML code** that has been rendered
* a **console where you enter JS code** and use jQuery

~~~

The tutorial does a good job of **gradually introducing new concepts** and **ramping up difficulty**.

And as **progress is saved** between sessions, there is nothing to lose by **getting started right now**! Try it out for a bit so you get the hang of it, and finish it later if you want!
