To truly wrap our brains around nested data you shall now **design your own language**!

~~~

That means **revisiting all the decisions** we just went through:

* how to **encapsulate** an object
* how to express object **type**
* how to express **attributes**, with and without values, and separation of all
* how to express **children**

~~~

Your language does **not have to be useful**, so you get bonus points for being far out!

It does however **have to be unambiguous**, so make your rules very clear!

~~~

When you have defined your rules, use them to **encode your family tree**!

1. Start with your **favourite grandparent**
2. **Ignore spouses** - we're only interested in children.
3. Decide what you should use for **type**. Name? Gender? Nationality?
4. Decide on a **number of attributes** to encode for each person. Name? Zodiac sign? Favourite folk metal band?

~~~

Yes, that means it's not a tree in the traditional sense, but something like this:

Send a **definition of your rules** and the **encoded family tree** to David!
