~~~

While steeling ourselves for what is to come;

1. open the **simplest possible editor** you can find (likely Notepad on Windows)
1. create a **simple html page** where you say hello to the world
1. **save the file** wherever, with the suffix `.html`
1. in your browser select **open file**, navigate to your file and open it
1. **bask in the glory** of your text showing up on screen!
